Greetings from Koh Phangan 🇹🇭 and the [Matrix Workation](https://matrix.org/blog/2026/02/13/this-week-in-matrix-2026-02-13/#matrix-workation-thailand-edition-th) (again!).

So I've been on the island for 3 weeks now and my time is almost up, I'll be flying back in a few hours so figured - on this very hot and lazy Monday - I'd keep up this latest blog posting attempt a little longer.

One of the main takeaways from last year was a desire to really get some shared / Matrix-related projects done. This was a personal goal too, I sat and lended an ear to others last year doing odd bits, but it was my intention this year to "make" something.

So I jumped onto this [Godot Matrix RTC](./2026-02-16-from-floorit-ipsum-to-godot-matrix-rtc.md) project pretty quick but also started something entirely my own: [Matrix Helm Charts](https://github.com/cyclikal94/matrix-helm-charts).

There is still a ways to go, I'm currently working on helm charts for the Mautrix bridges (starting with Telegram). Once the main work is done, I'm hoping I can put out charts for them all pretty quickly.

I'll save digging into this for a separate post, but it's been really cool to be working on a project idea of my own which I feel could be really useful to those deploying homeservers using ESS Community.

So what else have I been getting up to?

🍚 Thai Food.

The food has been unbelievably good, again! Khao Soi beef might just be one of the best dishes I've had in Thailand. I am already missing the food and I've not even left yet.

😀 The People.

I kinda know these people now, so it was great to just be a little more relaxed and enjoy the company. It's honestly been a constant laugh and so great to catch up with everyone again - it's weird how quickly you miss people, and I'm already regretting not staying longer.

🏄 Unbelievably, Kite Surfing.

Not really on my bingo card but after a little convincing I've been giving it a go. Making progress, bit-by-bit. It's an incredible mix of doing a whole bunch of things right, but also not over-thinking - and when everything comes together, it's a blast!

'Till next time 👋
